### Hi, I'm Benny ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a senior student majoring in CS at National Central University. I bring four months of AI and Data Engineering internship experience from a startup, where I focused on developing a recommendation system and optimizing a chatbot for a 30-second response time improvement. I'm passionate about AI and and backend development. If you have ideas or collaborations in these areas, feel free to connect!!
